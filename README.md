My Second Odin Repo!
This contains a simple HTML website of recipes featuring Chili Paneer, Guacamole, and Salsa!

The Skills that I have demonstrated are:
1. The ability to fill out a HTML boilerplate
2. The ability to create links to my other pages (Relative) and create links to images that exist on other websites (Absolute)
3. Create Unordered Lists and Ordered Lists
4. Committing my changes regularly when conducting this project to ensure VCS is capturing an audit trail of changes
